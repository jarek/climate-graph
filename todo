- when both a weatherbox and a {{Vancouver weatherbox}} template are found,
    download both and use one with more data, or merge data from both

- also, search wikisources for "{{main|Climate of ____}}" or similar. 
    follow link, see if there's data there, merge/use as above


astronomy stuff:

- get/calculate and graph sunrise/sunset times for my curiosity.
    from heavens-above maybe?
    or find the relevant formulas if h-a doesn't have a convenient api

- handle "% possible sunshine" as used in NYC weatherbox:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:New_York_City_weatherbox&action=edit
    this would again need astronomical information to get sunrise/sunset hours
    or daylight hours throughout the year
    (averaged over month for use with the NYC data)
